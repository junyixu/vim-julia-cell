*julia-cell.txt*  run code cells in Julia
*julia-cell*

This plugin allows you to easily run Python code from Vim in Julia,
including individual code cells similar to Jupyter notebooks and MATLAB.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                     *julia-cell-usage*

Before using julia-cell, familiarize yourself with the |slime| plugin.

julia-cell does not add any custom mappings. Instead, it is up to the user
to define custom mappings for the commands below. For example, you can add the
following to your .vimrc: >

    nmap <Leader>r :JuliaCellRun<CR>
    nmap <Leader>c :JuliaCellExecuteCell<CR>
    nmap <Leader>C :JuliaCellExecuteCellJump<CR>
    nmap <Leader>l :JuliaCellClear<CR>
    nmap <Leader>x :JuliaCellClose<CR>
    nmap <Leader>p :JuliaCellPrevCommand<CR>
    nmap <Leader>q :JuliaCellRestart<CR>

`<Leader>` is `\` (backslash) by default. The mappings above map `\r` to run
the current script in Julia, `\R` to run and time the script, `\c` to
execute only the current code cell, `\C` to execute the current code cell and
jump to the next cell, `\l` to clear the Julia screen, and `\x` to close all
Matplotlib figure windows.

You may also want to add something like the following to easily navigate
between code cells: >

    nmap [c :JuliaCellPrevCell<CR>
    nmap ]c :JuliaCellNextCell<CR>

Code cells are by default defined by Vim marks (see |mark|). It is also
possible to use special text in the code (referred to as tags) to mark the
start of code cells by adding the following to your vimrc: >

    let g:julia_cell_delimit_cells_by = 'tags'

In that case, julia-cell will by default interpret any lines containing `##`
as cell headers.

Note that the cell execution feature copies your code to the system clipboard.
You may want to avoid using this feature if your code contains sensitive data.

CONFIGURATION                                     *julia-cell-configuration*

The following configuration options allow you to specify how cells are
defined.

                                               *julia_cell_delimit_cells_by*
g:julia_cell_delimit_cells_by     Delimit cells by Vim marks (`'marks'`,
                                    default) or a special tag in the code
                                    (`'tags'`).

                                                    *julia-cell-valid-marks*
g:julia_cell_valid_marks          Which marks to use to mark the boundary
                                    between cells.
                                    Default: `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`

                                                            *julia-cell-tag*
g:julia_cell_tag                  What kind of comment tag to use to mark
                                    the boundary between cells
                                    (default `'##'`). This option is used only
                                    if `g:julia_cell_delimit_cells_by` is
                                    set to  `'tags'`.

FAQ                                                         *julia-cell-faq*

Q: The 'JuliaCellExecuteCell' and 'JuliaCellExecuteCellJump' commands ~
do not work, but other commands such as JuliaCellRun work. Why? ~
A: First, make sure you have Tkinter installed (otherwise you will get an
error message) and a supported clipboard program, see README.
Also make sure your `DISPLAY` variable is correct, see next question.

Q: 'JuliaCellExecuteCell' and 'JuliaCellExecuteCellJump' do not execute ~
the correct code cell, or I get an error about 'can't open display', ~
'could not open display', 'could not connect to display', or something ~
similar, what do I do? ~
A: Make sure your DISPLAY environment variable is correct, especially after
re-attaching a screen or tmux session. In tmux you can update the DISPLAY
variable with the following command:

    eval $(tmux showenv -s DISPLAY)

Q: Should I use 'marks' or 'tags' to define cells? ~
A: This depends on personal preference. I used to use `'tags'` because they
are similar to MATLAB's `%%` code sections. `'tags'` are nice if you want the
cells to be saved together with your files, and may be easier to start with. I
switched to `'marks'` after discovering that I can show the marks in the
left-most column. I find `'marks'` to be more flexible because you can add and
change cells without changing the code, which is nice when your code is under
version control.

Q: How do I show the marks in the left-most column? ~
A: Use the vim-signature plugin:
    https://github.com/kshenoy/vim-signature

Q: How to send only the current line or selected lines to Julia? ~
A: Use the features provided by vim-slime. The default mapping `C-c C-c` (hold
down Ctrl and tap the C key twice) will send the current paragraph or the
selected lines to Julia. See |slime| for more information.

Q: Why do I get "name 'plt' is not defined" when I try to close figures? ~
A: julia-cell assumes that you have imported `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` in
Julia. If you prefer to import `matplotlib.pyplot` differently, you can
achieve the same thing using vim-slime, for example by adding the following to
your .vimrc: >

    nmap <Leader>x :SlimeSend1 matplotlib.pyplot.close('all')<CR>

Q: How can I send other commands to Julia, e.g. '%who'? ~
A: You can easily send arbitary commands to Julia using the `:SlimeSend1`
command provided by vim-slime, e.g. `:SlimeSend1 %who`, and map these commands
to key combinations.

Q: Why isn't this plugin specific to Python by default? In other words, why ~
do I have to add all this extra stuff to make this plugin Python-specific? ~
A: This plugin was created with Python and Julia in mind, but I don't want
to restrict the plugin to Python by design. Instead, I have included examples
of how to use plugin managers to specify that the plugin should be loaded only
for Python files and how to create Python-specific mappings. If someone wants
to use this plugin for other filetypes, they can easily do so.

Q: Why is this plugin written in Python instead of pure Vimscript? ~
A: Because I feel more comfortable with Python and don't have the motivation
to learn Vimscript for this plugin. If someone implements a pure Vimscript
version, I would be happy to consider to merge it.
